# Tickets to the Avengers
The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

Johny is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

Can Johny sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?

Return TRUE (boolean), if Johny can sell a ticket to each person and give the change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return FALSE.

* Input will be an indefinite sequence of numbers separated by spaces
* Output should be "YES" or "NO" (without quotes or end of line)
