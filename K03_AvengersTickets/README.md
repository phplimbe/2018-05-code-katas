# Tickets to the Avengers
The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge 
line (queue). Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 euro bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 euros.

Johny is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

Can Johny sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly 
in the order people follow in the line?

Write a function that, given a queue representing each person's bills, returns `true` (the boolean), if Johny can sell 
a ticket to each person and give the change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return `false`.

* Work on `Clerk.php`

### Examples:

```
[25, 50] => true
[25, 100] => false (he can't give â‚¬75 change)
```
