# Code Katas

## Guidelines

1. You can write the solution in `program.php`. If you're using another language, you may want to adjust the `PROGRAM` 
and `SOLUTION_BIN` variables in `check.sh` so that your solution can be executed correctly.
2. Input will be sent via STDIN.
3. Output should be printed to STDOUT.

## Tips
PHP makes input arguments available at the `$argv` variable. The first element (`$argv[0]`) is the name of the program 
itself (e.g. `program.php`), but every argument after that are the actual arguments.
